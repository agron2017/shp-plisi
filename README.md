Tastiera Plisi (Albanian Keyboard Layout)

- Microsoft Windows: Load Plisi.klc on Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator to create installation files.
- Apple OSX: Load Plisi.keylayout on Ukelele to edit layout and create bundle for installation.
- Linux: Edit Linux code if needed. Copy the code and paste into "al" file in "/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/". Then edit files in "/usr/share/X11/xkb/rules" to make sure the Plisi layout is included.

I am not a programmer. Please help improve the software and documentation.
